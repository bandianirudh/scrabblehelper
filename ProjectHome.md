This program lets you fill in a scrabble board (using a friendly GUI) and enter your rack's letters to find every possible move on the board.  You can even use blanks, but I really wouldn't recommend it.  It takes a long time.  Fortunately, it sorts the words by score, so the highest scoring words are the first thing you see.

I've called this current release 1.0, but that's just because I think it works OK.  OK does not mean perfect.  But if you have any issues, please do email me.  I'm not sure which versions of the Java Runtime Environment this works with...  I use JRE 6.

I just released v1.1, just some nice updates to make it easier to use.

Cheers,
Nick
